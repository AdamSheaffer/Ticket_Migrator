Assuming you have a grasp of terminal and have a package manager (This walkthrough will use Node.js's package manager NPM [Download that here](https://nodejs.org/en/)), I will let you interpret this to your system, as I know everyone isn't on a mac. The first step is cloning the Repo.

1. Navigate to the directory where you wish to install the app and type:
```
git clone origin git@github.com:PythonWizards/Ticket_Migrator.git
