## Getting Started
This application will be hosted [here](migrator.bangazon.com). (:construction: currently not online :construction:)

Assuming you have a grasp of terminal and have a package manager (This walkthrough will use Node.js's package manager NPM [Download that here](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [python version 3.6.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/) ), I will let you interpret this to your system, as I know everyone isn't on a mac. The first step is cloning the Repo.

1. Navigate to the directory where you wish to install the app and type:
```
git clone origin git@github.com:PythonWizards/Ticket_Migrator.git
```
2. After the download ends, type `cd ./ticket_migrator/migrator_app/static/migrator_app`, then type  `npm i`. This will install any package dependencies. 

3. Next type `cd ..` to get back to the folder that contains the file `manage.py`

4. Next we get into our proper environment by typing `pipenv shell`.

5. Finally we run the application using `python manage.py runserver` and navigate in `127.0.0.1.8000` in a web browser.

:fire: Bazinga. You're in.
